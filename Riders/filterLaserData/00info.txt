Rider analysis SW

this code is obsolete and wrong, Kim SW is evolging and he will
provide soon a new example framework for the analysis

git clone https://github.com/gm2-it/test-beam-slac-jun16.git
cd test-beam-slac-jun16/Riders/filterLaserData/
make clean
make
./RiderAnaApp <file1.root> [<file2>.root ...]

this will read the slac test beam data and produce a reduced ntuple
with just the laser data read by the Riders
